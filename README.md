This program mimics a real coffee vending machine, allowing users to select a drink, handle payments, and track available resources.

# ‚ú® Features
  - Interactive command-line interface
  - Supports multiple drink options (menu-driven)
  - Handles virtual payment processing and resource management
  - Generates reports for remaining resources and collected money
  - Includes error handling for invalid inputs or unavailable drinks
  - Displays a custom ASCII logo banner (imported from coffee_machine_logo.py)

# ‚öôÔ∏è How to Run
  1. Clone or download this repository
  2. Make sure Python 3.x is installed
  3. Ensure all the following files are in the same directory:
    main.py (this main script)

# üß† Concepts Practiced
  - Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - Class composition and interaction
  - Exception handling (try/except)
  - Input validation
  - Loops and conditionals
  - Modular Python design

# üß∞ Possible Improvements
  - Add new drink types dynamically
  - Save report data to a file
  - Implement a user interface (Tkinter or web-based)
  - Add refill functionality for resources
